## Issues with the current microwave

In my opinion, the current microwave that I am using sees to be fine but have some minor issues.

    - The button lebels are not clear. For eg:  the Time Deforst, Weight Defrost does not indicate what
      is the actual purpose of the button until you do trial and error. 
    - There is EXPRESS COOK in between the numbers (2 and 5 )  which is not clear.
    - This HOLD with keys looks confusing as I was trying on the microwave, I was not able to figure it out.
    - he door handles are mechanically so that you will have to apply force to open it.


## Common uses of the microwave
    - Mostly used for fast heating. For example, for preaparing tea, heating the food.
    - Defrosting the refrigerated items such as meat,vegetables.
## Advantages of the Current Microwave
    - +30 SEC button is always handy. I tend to press that buttton for setting time even if I have to set it to 2 min.
    - It give me beeping sound once the heating has been done. 
    - The macro buttons (such as PIZZA, POPCORN) are also handy sometime.
