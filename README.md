# Microwave Interface -CS 4331 - Project 1

Project URL: https://sachinoo.github.io/p1.SachinKarki/.



## Introducction
    We have various tools we use it in day to day life. Machines / tools are used to simplify our 
    works but its not alwys perfect. They have some kind of flaws which will afftect the 
    effectivness of the microwave.Microwaves comes in different sizes, functionality and 
    different cost as well depending upon the feature that come with it.
    
    This report focues on the microwave that we have in our apartment or homes. Demonstrates
    some issues with it and also demonstrates the new effective design . The new design was build
    usig the processing platform. This new design eliminates the mechanical keys and  implements the 
    touch functionality whcih inputs from the touch on the screen.
    
## Current microwave in USE
    This demonstrates the use of microwave setting 30 seconds timer.

## Issues with the current microwave
![IMG_3031](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24665608/109348303-f4c5ba00-7839-11eb-93a0-03d55541d980.jpeg)

In my opinion, the current microwave that I am using sees to be fine but have some minor issues.

    - The button lebels are not clear. For eg:  the Time Deforst, Weight Defrost does not indicate what
      is the actual purpose of the button until you do trial and error. 
    - There is EXPRESS COOK in between the numbers (2 and 5 )  which is not clear.
    - This HOLD with keys looks confusing as I was trying on the microwave, I was not able to figure it out.
    - he door handles are mechanically so that you will have to apply force to open it.


## Common uses of the microwave
    - Mostly used for fast heating. For example, for preaparing tea, heating the food.
    - Defrosting the refrigerated items such as meat,vegetables.
    - 
## Advantages of the Current Microwave
    - +30 SEC button is always handy. I tend to press that buttton for setting time even if 
      I have to set it to 2 min.
    - It give me beeping sound once the heating has been done. 
    - The macro buttons (such as PIZZA, POPCORN) are also handy sometime.
    - 
## User Interaction
    The user has simple task to consider while using the microwave. In the current setting the user will
    have to open the door, set the timer and the heating will begin.
    
    If we have to look at the function that is in the microwave, there are some simple function while
    some function requires trial and error as the labels are not clear. Some of the problems was 
    discussed in the current issues section of this paage.
       
    The feedback to the user is provided by microwave usign a sound. Once the food is heated,  we can hear some
    beeping sound. This is convinient as we do have to sit by the microwave and wait especially when the 
    timer is for longer time.
   
    Following are some of the mistakes that an user might make while using it:
        - Once you press the number in the keypad, the timer starts

# New Designed Interface

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Interface Components
1.  Power Button 
    - This sets the state of the microwave to ON or OFF state. This would be the first step to operate the microwave.
2. Number Pad / Add 30 Seconds button
    - These buttons are used to set the timer for heating the food.
3. Open/ Close Door
    - This button is used for the door functionality of the door. Upon pressing the button, the door will 
      automatically open/ close depending in the state of the door.
4. Start / Stop Button
    - Start / Stop buttons have the same functionality as the name. Start will start the timer after setting the time and 
      Stop will stop the timer.
5. Express Cook
    - This helps you to select the opetions with pre defined times for each express button. 
6. Voice Button
    - This button is just a proposed button which can take voice commands. 
7. LCD Screen
    - Displays the Timer, state of the microwave and the messsage. 

## Suggested Desing in sketch
 This is the new design that might help to reduec the issues with the current design.
 
![PROPOSED DESIGN](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24665608/109361600-db7b3880-784e-11eb-92e6-68d3be452093.png)

  NOTE: This sketch was made using draw.io
  
    This new skeletion design shows that some of the issues could be fixed using the new design.
    We can see that there is On/ Off button which could be handy to save the energy when it is not 
    in use. Once, you turn on , it will ask the user to set the timer and hit start. This will fix 
    the issue that was mentioned above. Once you set the timer, you will have press start other wise
    it wont trigger the microwave. This could be handy when you mistakely set the wrong timer. 
    
    Another that that was improved in this prototype  was that voice command was added. This could let 
    the user set the timer using the reccognized voice commands. 
    
    Express cook was aslo organized so that it is easier for the user to select the pre- defined timers.
    
    The door would open with the door button or with the voice command.

        This designed was build using the processing platform with the libraries availabe in the processing.
