## Issues with the current microwave

In my opinion, the current microwave that I am using sees to be fine but have some minor issues.
1. The button lebels are not clear. For eg:  the Time Deforst, Weight Defrost does not indicate what
    is the actual purpose of the button until you do trial and error. 
2. There is EXPRESS COOK in between the numbers (2 and 5 )  which is not clear.

3. This HOLD with keys looks confusing as I was trying on the microwave, I was not able to figure it out.
4. The door handles are mechanically so that you will have to apply force to open it.

## Interface Components
1.  Power Button 
    - This sets the state of the microwave to ON or OFF state. This would be the first step to operate the microwave.

      Stop will stop the timer.
